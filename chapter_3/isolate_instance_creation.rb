=begin
  The creation of Wheel has now been isolated in its own wheel method and the
  Wheel instance is now lazily created. It's creation is deferred until
  gear_inches invokes it. Although Gear still knows far too much, dependencies
  are now publicly exposed and now the class is more reusable and allows
  refactoring when needed.
