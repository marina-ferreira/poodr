=begin
Instead of looking at Mechanic, TripCoordinator and Driver as three separate
objects, it's possible to group all of them as a Preparer. Preparers want to
prepare trips, so every Preparer knows how to answer to prepare_trip.

üí° What is a Preparer?
It's an *abstraction*, it's a public interface based on a idea.

Abstractions are possible when objects are treated as if they are defined by
their behavior rather than its class.

* Polymorphism

- the state of having many forms
- in OOP: the ability of many different objects to respond to the same message with their own implementation of it. A single message has then many (poly) forms (morphs)
- duck-typing, inheritance and behavior sharing modules are a kind of polymorphism

=begin
* Recognizing Hidden Ducks

The following pattern indicates the presence of a hidden duck:

1. Case statement that switch on class

  It switches on class names of domain objects of your application. This pattern
  indicates that classes have something in common.

2. kind_of? or is_a?

  There are several ways to check the type of an object. Using either *kind_of?*
  or *is_a?* (synonymous) is pretty much the same as using *case/switch* and it
  causes you the same problems.

3. responds_to?

  It slightly decreases the number of dependencies but the code is still too
  much bound to class, although it does not depend on class names directly.
